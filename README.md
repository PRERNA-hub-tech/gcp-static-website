## üöÄ How to Set Up Your Own Static Website on Google Cloud

If you want to host your own website, here‚Äôs a simple guide to get started using **Cloud Shell**:

### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Storage Bucket

1. Open **Google Cloud Console**: [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Open **Cloud Shell** by clicking the terminal icon in the top-right corner of the console.
3. Run the following command to create a **new bucket** (replace `your-unique-bucket-name` with your desired bucket name):

### 
gsutil mb gs://your-unique-bucket-name

### To make the bucket publicly accessible, run:
gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://your-unique-bucket-name

# Enable website hosting on the bucket by setting the index.html as the Main Page and 404.html as the Error Page:
gsutil web set -m index.html -e 404.html gs://your-unique-bucket-name

### Step 2: Upload Your Files to Google Cloud Storage

1. In the Google Cloud Console, go to **Storage** > **Browser**.
2. Click your bucket name.
3. Click **Upload Files** and upload your HTML and CSS files (like `index.html`, `about.html`, etc.).
  
# Access Your Website
http://storage.googleapis.com/your-unique-bucket-name/index.html

Just replace your-unique-bucket-name with the name of your actual bucket.
